Download 68-points facial landmarks separately, and paste it in respective folders


Our project provides a vision-based humancomputer interface. The interface senses and interprets eyeblinks as controls along with gaze detection methods. We used image processing methods like haar-like features for automatic face detection and eye tracking and blink detection based on landmarks. The Gaze detection mechanism helps in easy controlling of the mouse. People with disabilities can use this method to communicate effectively. A heatmap is also generated for research purposes so that in future developments, this data can be used to design a more efficient layout for the controls. Given the necessity to move towards online solutions, such data can cater to the needs of a variety of sectors.
